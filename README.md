PM's dotfiles
=============

Here are configuration files, which I use for my Linux environments. They are tested on Debian and archlinux.

## Installation
Clone this repo somewhere in your home directory. Then execute this script, which will automatically symlink the dotfiles at appropriate places.

```shell
$ ./link.sh
```
Don't worry about your previous dotfiles, my script will already add the _.old_ extension to them instead of overwriting them.
